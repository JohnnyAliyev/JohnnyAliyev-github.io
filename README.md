### [Car Price  Estimation Using Artificial Neural Networks](https://github.com/JohnnyAliyev/JohnnyAliyev-github.io/blob/main/1_Car_Price_Estimation_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks.ipynb)

Accurately estimating car prices is challenging due to various factors like model, mileage, and year of manufacture. Traditional methods often fall short in capturing the complexity of these variables. This project utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to develop a predictive model for car price estimation. By leveraging historical data, the ANN can identify patterns and relationships to deliver more accurate price predictions, offering valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market.



### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
