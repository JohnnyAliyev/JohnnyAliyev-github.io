#### [Car Price  Estimation Using Artificial Neural Networks](https://github.com/JohnnyAliyev/JohnnyAliyev-github.io/blob/main/1_Car_Price_Estimation_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks.ipynb)

- Estimating car prices accurately is difficult due to factors like model, mileage, and year. This project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to develop a predictive model that leverages historical data to deliver more precise price predictions, providing valuable insights for buyers and sellers in the automotive market.
